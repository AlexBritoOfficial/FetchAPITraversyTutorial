I am a motivated, first generation LatinX American. Raised by a single mother, who immigrated from Brazil by herself at age 13,
I grew up seeing firsthand the results of sustained, unrelenting, hard work. While my brother and I got dressed for school, my mother prepared
herself for full days and long nights running her own catering company that serviced Boston College, Harvard University, and various churches
and privately owned companies. With my mother as my role model, I wake up each day to compete with the best version of myself, 
in Software Development, and every other aspect of my life as well. I enjoy working with others and believe that teamwork is a 
necessary component of success. From a failing high school student, to earning an associate degree in Computer Science, then landing
an internship at ASICS Digital as a Mobile Engineer and now as an engineering student at Wentworth Institute of Technology, 
I’ve gathered life experience as well as professional experience. It is this combination of practical and professional experience 
and my inner drive that sets me apart. Simply put, I’ve come a long way, and I have a long way to go. I understand that you will receive a 
number of applications for this role. Please see my attached resume and consider meeting with me for an interview. Contact me at 
(phone number) with any questions. Thank you for your time and consideration.
